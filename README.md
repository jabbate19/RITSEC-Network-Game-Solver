Python Script to Solve RITSEC 2021 CTF - Week 3, Hard 1

NOTE: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU RUIN THE FLAG FOR YOURSELF.
PLEASE DO NOT LOOK AT THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT YOURSELF!!!

The VM located in Week3IntroToNetworkingFixed.ovf runs a service on port 10000 that requires 100 problems to be completed for a flag
This flag was part of a "Capture the Flag" program for RITSEC members (flags.ritsec.club)
To streamline this process, the python script was created that isolates the problem type and numbers in set, computes an answer, and sends it back to the service.
